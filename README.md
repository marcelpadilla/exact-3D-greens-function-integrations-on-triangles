## Introduction

We compute analytically the Green's and its gradient and product with linear functions on a triangle T in R3.

Let x be an evaluation point, r(x,y) = |y-x| and Let h(x) be a linear function on the triangle with value 1 at the first triangle vertex and 0 on the other vertices.

We compute the following integrals 

$\int_T \ G(x,y) dA_y = \int_T \ \frac{1}{|y-x|} dA_y$

$\int_T \ h(x) \ G(x,y) dA_y = \int_T \ h(x) \ \frac{1}{|y-x|} dA_y$

$\int_T \ \partial_{n_y} G(x,y) dA_y = \int_T \ \langle n_y , \nabla \frac{1}{|y-x|} \rangle dA_y$

$\int_T \ h(x) \ \partial_{n_y} G(x,y) dA_y = \int_T \ h(x) \ \langle n_y , \nabla \frac{1}{|y-x|} \rangle dA_y$

$\int_T \ \nabla G(x,y) dA_y = \int_T \ \nabla \frac{1}{|y-x|} dA_y$

$\int_T \ h(x) \ \nabla G(x,y) dA_y = \int_T \ h(x) \ \nabla \frac{1}{|y-x|} dA_y$

The analytic computation is performed based on [Graglia]'s results.

## How to Use

Copy ```greens_triangle_integration.py``` into your project and import it using
```python
import greens_triangle_integration
```
**Function:**

```
greens_triangle_integration.integrate(
    evaluation_points, triangle, values_of_interest)
```

- **Input:**
    - evaluation_points
        - A numpy array of the $x \in \mathbb{R}^3$ values.
    - triangle
        - a numpy array of 3 points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that represent a non-degenrate triangle and defines the integration domain $y\in T$.
    - values_of_interest
        - a list of strings specifying what to return in the dictionary of results.
            
            | Value of Interest | Integral |
            |-------------------|-----------|
            | 'G'               | $\int_T \ G(x,y) dA_y$ |
            | 'h_G'             | $\int_T \ h \ G(x,y) dA_y$ |
            | 'n_grad_G'        | $\int_T \ \partial_{n_y} G(x,y) dA_y$ |
            | 'h_n_grad_G'      | $\int_T \ h(x) \ \partial_{n_y} G(x,y) dA_y$ |
            | 'grad_G'          | $\int_T \ \nabla G(x,y) dA_y$ |
            | 'h_grad_G'        | $\int_T \ h(x) \ \nabla G(x,y) dA_y$ |
        - any call involving $h$, returns a numpy array of dimensions (nr_evaluation_points,3) with the $i$-th column being the integral with the linear function $hi$, where $hi$ is the linear function that reaches the value 1 on the $i$-th triangle vertex and 0 on the other vertices.
- **Output:**
    - integration_results
        - The analytic integral values on the evaluation points, in the form of numpy arrays, stored in a dictionary that can be accessed by the strings mentioned in the input.

**Example use:**
```python
import numpy as np
import greens_triangle_integration

# prep
evaluation_points = np.random.rand(100, 3)
triangle = np.random.rand(3, 3)
values_of_interest = ['h_G','h_n_grad_G']
# do
integration_results = greens_triangle_integration.integrate(
    evaluation_points, triangle, values_of_interest)
# read 
Int_G = integration_results['h_G']
Int_h_n_grad_G = integration_results['h_n_grad_G']

```


## Demo


Simply run the ```greens_triangle_integration_demo.py```, and pip install missing packages if prompted.


An abitrary triangle is generated by the vertices triangle[0], triangle[1], triangle[2].
A wide selection of test evaluation points are generated.
The a numerical integration is performed via scipy.integrate.dblquad.

The test evaluation points are lines going through:
- a point further outside of the triangle plane
- a point in the triangle plane but not in the triangle or along an extended edge
- a point on the extended edge of a triangle
- a point on the extended edge of a triangle but off the other direction
- a point in the triangle but not on an edge
- a point on an edge but not a vertex
- a triangle vertex (the first one, where h=1) 

The formulas have been adjusted to not require a transformation into the local triangle frame.
Additionally, an orientation dependant singularity issue on the extended edge of a triangle has been fixed.

Important note: When an evaluation point is at the boundary of the triangle, the tangential part of the gradient integrals become singular.

## Results

Running the code will show you the following results:

## Discussion
The analtic integration results are robust to the many possible cases and return the same result as the numerical integration based on scipy's dblquad. Away from singularities the analytic integration is around 10e5 times faster, while closer to the singularities this reaches 10e6 speed-up using the default settings of dblquad.

However, the singularity at the tangential component when integrating $\nabla G(x,y)$ when $x \in \partial T$ seems to be unresolvable. Luckily, the normal gradient $\partial_n G(x,y)$ does not have this problem.
The main problem is that the values of *f2* in the code become ill defined. At the tangential singularities they are set to zero, which is useful when having
two triangle in the same plane next to each other, where these singularities would cancel out.

This code was created for dealing with boundary integral equations.

It is straight forward to apply this code to flat polygons for the integrations not involving *h(x)*. For *h(x)* integrations the flat polygon must be split into triangles.
